# BuildOnSave

Put your CPU's cores to use and minimize the time to wait for your build!

## Introduction 

BuildOnSave is an extension for Visual Studio 2017 that builds the current solution as soon a file is saved, and in combination with the extension [SaveAllTheTime](https://github.com/pragmatrix/SaveAllTheTime/releases), enables a live, background build experience while you type.

### Features

- There is a menu named BuildOnSave in the Visual Studio menu bar with options to disable BuildOnSave and to specify what excactly should be built. Options are stored per solution.
- An output "pane" is registered for BuildOnSave and activates as soon a build starts. 
- An icon is added to the Standard toolbar that shows the build status for background builds. **red** for build failed, **yellow** to show that the build is indeterminate, and **green** means ready to go. If the icon shows an outline instead of a filled circle, a build is currently active. Clicking the icon opens the BuildOnSave output pane.

### Options

These options define what happens as soon one file is saved.

- **Build Solution**  
  Rebuilds the complete solution.
- **Build Startup Project**  
  Rebuilds the startup project.
- **Disable When Debugging** : disable the recompilation when the debugger is attached. This allows tools like LivePP to hotreload changes more rapidly.
- **Relaunch build when saved** : force a relaunch of the background build when a saved event is detected instead of waiting for current build to finish.
- **DoNotRunIfProcessExistList** : code option modifiable in code for now. When one of those process is running, the build will not be launched.

## Download & Installation

At the [Visual Studio Extension Gallery](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pragmatrix.BuildOnSave), or via the [Releases tab](https://github.com/pragmatrix/BuildOnSave/releases) here on Github where you can download the `BuildOnSave.vsix` file and double click it to install it.

## Development & Contribution

Clone the repository and open the solution file `BuildOnSave.sln` in Visual Studio 2017. BuildOnSave should compile out of the box.

To start the Experimental Instance of Visual Studio for a debug session (F5 or Ctrl+F5), add the following to the Debug tab of BuildOnSave's project properties:

- Start external program:  
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe`
- Command line arguments:  
  `/rootsuffix Exp`

For developing BuildOnSave, please use tabs for indenting.

Debug information is written to a local Seq server. You need to install [Seq] to take a look at the logs.
