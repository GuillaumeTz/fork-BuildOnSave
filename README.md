# BuildOnSave

Never wait for a build anymore!

## Introduction 

This is an extension for Visual Studio that builds the current solution as soon a file is saved, and in combination with wonderful extension [SaveAllTheTime](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ee676c7f-83e8-4ef8-87ab-22a95ae8f1d4), enables a live, background build experience while you type.

Notes:

- Runs with Visual Studio 2015 only, barely tested, and highly experimental.
- Some debug information is written to the Windows debug output, which can be monitored with [DebugView](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/debugview.aspx).
- There is a menu named BuildOnSave in the Visual Studio menu bar. Right now it does nothing :)

## Download & Installation

[Releases are here](https://github.com/pragmatrix/BuildOnSave/releases). Download the BuildOnSave.vsix file and double click it to install it into Visual Studio.
